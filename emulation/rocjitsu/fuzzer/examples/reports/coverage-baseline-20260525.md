# rocfuzz coverage baseline, 2026-05-25

This report is generated from the maintained real-library smoke and patch-report gates. It is a coverage-quality baseline, not an AFL crash campaign report; crash and hang findings are reported by `summarize-afl-campaign.py` from `afl-fuzz` output roots.

## Summary

`Patched sites` is the successfully applied instrumentation count; `Device slots` is the observed runtime delta count. `Policy hashed`, `Policy fixed`, `Degraded branch edges`, `PrevBB sites`, and `PrevBB fallbacks` come from planner accounting in patch reports and can be higher when failed or partially patched events kept diagnostic plan data.

## Per-Example Details

### `rocblas-sgemm`

- Status: device branch coverage.

- Findings: smoke baseline only; no crash/hang campaign findings assessed.
- Limitation: The default path has useful previous-BB hashed Tensile coverage, but more sites still need safer relocation, opaque-instruction modeling, and temporary-register planning.

### `rocfft-c2c`

- Findings: smoke baseline only; no crash/hang campaign findings assessed.
- Limitation: Generated FFT kernels produce device deltas; twiddle_gen_* is still reported as no-patchable-sites until its descriptor/prologue interaction is understood.

### `rocrand-uniform`

- Status: device branch coverage.
- Coverage mix: fixed branch counters.
- Progress: 2/2 patch events succeeded, 17 edge sites were patched; policy accounting selected hashed sites=0, fixed sites=17, degraded logical branch edges=0, previous-BB branch sites=0, and previous-BB sites degraded to fixed=0 (none); 9 device slots changed with counter delta 55421738.
- `default` (`emulation/rocjitsu/fuzzer/examples/build/rocrand_uniform_report.jsonl`): 2/2 successful patch events, 17 patched sites; policy accounting hashed=0, fixed=17, degraded_branch_edges=0, previous_bb_branch_sites=0, previous_bb_site_fallbacks=0, fixed_fallback_causes=none, 9 device slots, strategies `self-contained-fixed-branch`=2, reasons `loader-context-fixed-branch-preferred`=1, `loader-context-self-contained`=1.
- Selected edges in `default`: `_ZN12rocrand_impl6system6detail17t...13xorwow_engineEjPfmS9_jjmEEEvDpT4_` cond-branch@0x13ae8 fixed-counter slot=26498 cave=local-cave bytes=108, `_ZN12rocrand_impl6system6detail17t...13xorwow_engineEjPfmS9_jjmEEEvDpT4_` cond-branch@0x13bc0 fixed-counter slot=20292 cave=local-cave bytes=108, `_ZN12rocrand_impl6system6detail17t...device13xorwow_engineEjjyyEEEvDpT4_` branch@0x15c fixed-counter slot=2268 cave=local-cave bytes=52, `_ZN12rocrand_impl6system6detail17t...device13xorwow_engineEjjyyEEEvDpT4_` branch@0x3f0 fixed-counter slot=17972 cave=local-cave bytes=52, ....
- Low-edge attribution: `loader_scoped_kernel_filter`=1708, `cfg_shape_no_branch_edge`=9.
- Sampled skipped instructions: `s_endpgm` for `terminator exits kernel` x2 (0xbfb00000), `s_mov_b32` for `block falls through without a branch terminator` (0xbea80080), `v_add_co_ci_u32` for `block falls through without a branch terminator` (0xd5207c0b, 0x01aa1601).

- Findings: smoke baseline only; no crash/hang campaign findings assessed.
- Limitation: Coverage is shallow but validates launch-scoped KPACK/HSA-reader coverage and runtime shadow launch redirection.

- Coverage mix: fixed branch counters.
- Progress: 2/3 patch events succeeded, 23 edge sites were patched; policy accounting selected hashed sites=0, fixed sites=23, degraded logical branch edges=0, previous-BB branch sites=0, and previous-BB sites degraded to fixed=0 (none); 12 device slots changed with counter delta 1982.
- `default` (`emulation/rocjitsu/fuzzer/examples/build/rocsparse_spmv_report.jsonl`): 2/3 successful patch events, 23 patched sites; policy accounting hashed=0, fixed=23, degraded_branch_edges=0, previous_bb_branch_sites=0, previous_bb_site_fallbacks=0, fixed_fallback_causes=none, 12 device slots, strategies `self-contained-fixed-branch`=3, reasons `loader-context-fixed-branch-preferred`=2, `entry-liveness-preflight-rejected-fixed-registers`=1.
- Selected edges in `default`: `_ZN9rocsparseL12scale_kernelILj256...const_host_device_scalarIT2_EEPT1_b` branch@0x3da0 fixed-counter slot=2238 cave=appended-cave bytes=52, `_ZN9rocsparseL12scale_kernelILj256...const_host_device_scalarIT2_EEPT1_b` cond-branch@0x3d28 fixed-counter slot=3618 cave=appended-cave bytes=108, `_ZN9rocsparseL12scale_kernelILj256...const_host_device_scalarIT2_EEPT1_b` cond-branch@0x3d3c fixed-counter slot=24088 cave=appended-cave bytes=108, `_ZN9rocsparseL12scale_kernelILj256...const_host_device_scalarIT2_EEPT1_b` cond-branch@0x3d60 fixed-counter slot=16898 cave=appended-cave bytes=108, ....

- AFL-visible device showmap: `rocfuzz_example_rocsparse_spmv_showmap.a.device` has 10 device tuples, `rocfuzz_example_rocsparse_spmv_showmap.b.device` has 12, hashes are different.
- Findings: smoke baseline only; no crash/hang campaign findings assessed.
- Limitation: The retained wrapper uses the non-persistent target because the rocSPARSE handle path is not yet stable across AFL deferred forkserver boundaries.

### `rocsolver-getrf`

- Status: device branch coverage.
- Coverage mix: fixed branch counters.
- Progress: 6/6 patch events succeeded, 46 edge sites were patched; policy accounting selected hashed sites=0, fixed sites=46, degraded logical branch edges=0, previous-BB branch sites=0, and previous-BB sites degraded to fixed=0 (none); 33 device slots changed with counter delta 7847.
- `default` (`emulation/rocjitsu/fuzzer/examples/build/rocsolver_getrf_report.jsonl`): 6/6 successful patch events, 46 patched sites; policy accounting hashed=0, fixed=46, degraded_branch_edges=0, previous_bb_branch_sites=0, previous_bb_site_fallbacks=0, fixed_fallback_causes=none, 33 device slots, strategies `self-contained-fixed-branch`=6, reasons `loader-context-fixed-branch-preferred`=3, `loader-context-self-contained`=3.

- Findings: smoke baseline only; no crash/hang campaign findings assessed.
- Limitation: Activation kernels are small. The current value is proving that the entry-unsafe MIOpen path uses self-contained fixed branch counters without entry redirection.
